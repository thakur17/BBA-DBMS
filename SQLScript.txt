First, we create a database called College (This should be done once) using the following SQL DDL command.

CREATE DATABASE College

After creating the database named College, we need to connect to this database using following command.

USE College

Now, we are going to create five related tables, using the following script (create one table at a time).

CREATE TABLE Student (
    Sid int primary key,
    Sname nvarchar(40),
    Level nvarchar(15),
    Age numeric(5,2),
    Gender nvarchar(10)
)


create table Course (
Cid int primary key,
Cname nvarchar(40),
Credit_hr int
)

create table Teacher (
Tid int primary key,
Tname nvarchar(40),
Age numeric(5,2)
)

create table Enrolled_by (
Sid int,
Cid int,
CONSTRAINT FK_Student FOREIGN KEY 
	(Sid) REFERENCES Student(Sid),
CONSTRAINT FK_Course FOREIGN KEY 
	(Cid) REFERENCES Course(Cid)
)

(This table links the rows of Student and Course tables via foreign key contraints, implementing many-to-many relations with one to many)

create table Taught_by (
Tid int,
Cid int,
CONSTRAINT FK_Teacher FOREIGN KEY 
	(Tid) REFERENCES Teacher (Tid),
CONSTRAINT FK_Course_Teacher FOREIGN KEY 
	(Cid) REFERENCES Course(Cid)
)

(This table links the rows of Teacher and Course tables via foreign key contraintsimplementing many-to-many relations with one to many)

Now, use inser into command to enter some sample data in each table as below. (You can use right click on the table name and open table option if you wish).

insert into Student Values (101, 'Ram Prasad', 'Under graduate', 17, 'Male')
insert into Student Values (102, 'Babita Kumari', 'Under graduate', 18, 'Female')
insert into Student Values (103, 'Cathy Rime', 'Graduate', 20, 'Female')
insert into Student Values (104, 'Sita Pant', 'Graduate', 22, 'Female')
insert into Student Values (105, 'Gita Devi', 'Under graduate', 16, 'Female')
insert into Student Values (106, 'Hari Prasad', 'Graduate', 22, 'Male')
insert into Student Values (107, 'Suresh Tamang', 'Under graduate', 15, 'Male')
insert into Student Values (108, 'Jayanti Kumari', 'Graduate', 26, 'Female')


insert into Course Values (101, 'Database Management', 3);
insert into Course Values (102, 'Accounting', 4);
insert into Course Values (103, 'Finance', 2);
insert into Course Values (104, 'English', 4);
insert into Course Values (105, 'Management', 3);
insert into Course Values (106, 'Organization Behaviour', 6);


insert into Teacher Values (1, 'Thakur Upadhyay', 52);
insert into Teacher Values (2, 'Hari Adhikari', 44);
insert into Teacher Values (3, 'Sonam Lama', 33);
insert into Teacher Values (4, 'Sita Kumari', 26);
insert into Teacher Values (5, 'Gita Devi', 29);


insert into Enrolled_by Values (101, 101);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (101, 102);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (101, 103);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (101, 104);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (102, 101);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (102, 102);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (102, 106);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (103, 102);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (103, 104);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (103, 101);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (105, 104);
insert into Enrolled_by Values (105, 101);


insert into Taught_by Values (1, 101)
insert into Taught_by Values (2, 106)
insert into Taught_by Values (2, 102)
insert into Taught_by Values (2, 104)
insert into Taught_by Values (3, 105)
insert into Taught_by Values (3, 104)
insert into Taught_by Values (4, 106)

After inserting all these rows in the respective tables, we can use multiple queries to get the required information from the database. See the book's example
play around many permutation combinations of Select queries.
